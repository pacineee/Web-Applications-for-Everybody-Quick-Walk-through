## **Website Hosting**

Web hosting is an online service that allows you to publish your website files to the internet. So, anyone who has access to the internet can get access to your website. In practice, it usually refers to the service you get from a specific web hosting provider.

Web Hosting provides a secure place to store online content. The code, images, videos, and text that comprise a website all have to be stored somewhere. Without a stable digital repository, none of us could consistently access content on the web. That makes hosting one of the most critical parts of developing an online presence for anyone, from huge companies to small-scale personal accounts.

Web hosting allows users to store content offsite, reducing local storage costs and the associated physical footprint. It also makes it easier to build a genuinely durable web presence, with built-in advantages like back-ups for security and support.


Some web hosting happens locally via personal computers or servers, but cloud-based third-party providers are used more frequently.

**Ways to getting started with an online Website**

- Register a domain: You’ll buy this from a domain name registrar like Domain.com, Bluehost, HostGator, GoDaddy, or Google Domain, just to name a few. You pick a unique name to simplify people remembering your IP address (which is just a string of numbers). It’s much easier to remember “HP.com” than “50.32.247.170,” for example. The domain is the same no matter who you buy it from, but the pricing is different depending on services and add-ons.


- Nameservers (DNS): The nameserver is the middle man that points your website visitors toward the correct IP address. Many times the same company will provide both your registrar and DNS services, but you can choose to go with a different DNS if you want. Some common ones are CloudFlare, OpenDNS, CleanBrowsing, and Google Public DNS.


- Web hosting: The actual files that make up the website reside in a server maintained by your web hosting company. Again, this can be the same company as your registrar and DNS server, or you can use a different one for this part of the process.
