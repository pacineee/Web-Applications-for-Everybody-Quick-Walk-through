## **Website Hosting**

Web hosting is an online service that allows you to publish your website files to the internet. So, anyone who has access to the internet can get access to your website. In practice, it usually refers to the service you get from a specific web hosting provider.

Web Hosting provides a secure place to store online content. The code, images, videos, and text that comprise a website all have to be stored somewhere. Without a stable digital repository, none of us could consistently access content on the web. That makes hosting one of the most critical parts of developing an online presence for anyone, from huge companies to small-scale personal accounts.

Web hosting allows users to store content offsite, reducing local storage costs and the associated physical footprint. It also makes it easier to build a genuinely durable web presence, with built-in advantages like back-ups for security and support.


Some web hosting happens locally (**Localhost**) via personal computers or servers, but cloud-based third-party providers are used more frequently.

**Ways to getting started with an online Website**

- Register a domain: You’ll buy this from a domain name registrar like Domain.com, Bluehost, HostGator, GoDaddy, or Google Domain, just to name a few. You pick a unique name to simplify people remembering your IP address (which is just a string of numbers). It’s much easier to remember “HP.com” than “50.32.247.170,” for example. The domain is the same no matter who you buy it from, but the pricing is different depending on services and add-ons.


- Nameservers (DNS): The nameserver is the middle man that points your website visitors toward the correct IP address. Many times the same company will provide both your registrar and DNS services, but you can choose to go with a different DNS if you want. Some common ones are CloudFlare, OpenDNS, CleanBrowsing, and Google Public DNS.


- Web hosting: The actual files that make up the website reside in a server maintained by your web hosting company. Again, this can be the same company as your registrar and DNS server, or you can use a different one for this part of the process.

### Types of web hosting

**Shared Hosting**
Shared hosting is when a web hosting provider hosts a number of different websites on the same server. It is the most affordable form of hosting because you share the same server, so you split costs. If you are looking to start a blog or have a business that’s just starting up, then shared hosting is a good option.

In the past, sharing a server could lead to problems where a spike in traffic or resource usage from a single site would slow down its “neighbouring” websites. However, these days web hosting subscriptions come with a generous amount of resources that ensure good performance.

**VIRTUAL PRIVATE SERVERS**

Virtual private server (VPS) hosting is similar to shared hosting, but your files are stored in a dedicated space with dedicated resources. The cost is typically higher as well, but this solution reduces the risk of sharing hardware with your provider’s other clients or subscribers.

**DEDICATED HOSTING**

This provides a dedicated server, which cuts the security and performance risks associated with shared hosting. You can also gain substantial functionality, though this increases the need for regular management and maintenance, and will increase costs.

**MANAGED HOSTING**

You have access to a dedicated server, but you don’t have the same administrative options. Managed hosting leaves security and maintenance responsibilities with your provider, leaving you to manage content via FTP (File Transfer Protocol), the rules that networked computers use when they “talk” to each other.

**CLOUD HOSTING***

Cloud hosting is a newer option that uses resource sharing and scale to drive down costs and reduce the risk of noticeable service disruptions. It can be more affordable compared to other options, but make sure you understand how your plan’s pricing works before committing to one.
While these are the 5 most commonly used options, there are other forms of web hosting available. These include home servers that you set up entirely on your own. But as with any DIY tech project, make sure you do plenty of research beforehand.

**WordPress Hosting**

WordPress Hosting simply means hosting that has been optimised for WordPress on a server level to ensure smooth sailing. 
This means the web hosting plan is optimized to use WordPress as a CMS. 

The web hosting provider has ensured their servers can run WordPress as a CMS smoothly and efficiently, and the web hosting service will handle any WordPress CMS updates or issues. WordPress is more user-friendly than other CMSs, like Joomla and Drupal, and still offers a lot of templates, widgets and plug-ins to create the best site for you.

**What is CMS !?**

A CMS is a tool people can use to customize their website's appearance and what content is displayed on it. You can also use a website builder to help create your site, but these builders may offer limited tools and control over how your site looks. In most cases you also don't own any of the design content on your site so it could vanish without you knowing. 

With a CMS, you have greater control over how your site looks. More design tools are available through a CMS.

**Remark:** Due to security vulnerabilities and many attacks to WordPress you may need to double check plugins or themes, 
I recommend using security checked (tested) WordPress plugins or themes.

About the web hosting providers I don't recommend any, you may need to choose from many best providers out there and I'm sure you will go with the best.

Happy hosting...!
