## **Database**

A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.

Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data.

There are many different **types of databases**. Below image shows these types;

## SQL

SQL is a short-form of the structured query language, and it is pronounced as "S-Q-L" or sometimes as See-Quell.

MySQL was made by a Swedish company, MySQL AB, established by Swedes David Axmark, Allan Larsson, and Finland Swede Michael "Monty" Widenius. The original improvement of MySQL by Widenius and Axmark started in 1994. The primary version of MySQL showed up on 23 May 1995.


### SQL!?

SQL is a database computer language designed for the retrieval and management of data in a **relational database**.

Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS) like MySQL, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres and SQL Server use SQL.

**Applications of SQL**

- As mentioned before, SQL is one of the most widely used query language over the databases. I'm going to list few of them here:

- Allows users to access data in the relational database management systems.

- Allows users to describe the data.

- Allows users to define the data in a database and manipulate that data.

- Allows to embed within other languages using SQL modules, libraries & pre-compilers.

- Allows users to create and drop databases and tables.

- Allows users to create view, stored procedure, functions in a database.

- Allows users to set permissions on tables, procedures and views.

### What is MySQL and how does it work!?

MySQL is an open source relational database management system based on **SQL**. It was designed and optimized for web applications and can run on any platform. As new and different requirements emerged with the internet, MySQL became the platform of choice for web developers and web-based applications. Because itâ€™s designed to process millions of queries and thousands of transactions, MySQL is a popular choice for ecommerce businesses that need to manage multiple money transfers. On-demand flexibility is the primary feature of MySQL.

Also, MySQL named after the daughter of co-founder Michael Widenius whose name is "My".

MySQL is the DBMS behind some of the top websites and web-based applications in the world, including Airbnb, Uber, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Verizon, and YouTube.

Both MySQL and SQL Server support multiple programming languages. Both RDBMS support PHP, Java, C++, Python, Ruby, Visual Basic, Delphi, Go and R. But MySQL additionally supports programming languages like Perl, Scheme, Tcl, Haskel and Eiffel.

With **PHP**, you can easily connect and manipulate MySQL as the most popular database system used with PHP.
PHP is a language that gives you the flexibility to connect and work with different databases while developing your webpage.

MySQL must be a good choiceðŸ˜‹
