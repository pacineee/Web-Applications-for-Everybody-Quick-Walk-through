## JavaScript

JavaScript is in many ways called **JS** as it's abbreviation.

### What is JavaScript and how does it work!?

JavaScript is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document.

It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time.


Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by using it on **client-side** or/and **Server-side**

**Client-side** JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.

**Server-side** JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

### JS Functioning

JavaScript supports a compact set of statements, specifically control flow statements, that you can use to incorporate a great deal of interactivity in your application.
Again you can also debugg Js in browser inspect tools "console". Good error handling way to work with.

Tip: Apart from the name itself, JavaScript has no relation to *Java*. Beginners often get confused between the two languages. Remember that Java is an entirely different language made for a different purpose (although youâ€™ll still find it running on certain website backends).
Meanwhile both JavaScript and Java have a C-like syntax.

JavaScript can also be written inside Html (Inline JS) file or out side / different file (Outline JS).

JavaScript have many different Frameworks and Libraries in work. Some of the popular and most used examples are; **Vue.js, React.js, Angular, Node.js, Ember.js**, the list goes on...

Learn JavaScript as hard as you can and it will pay-off!
