## Conclusion

In this Repo we cover main technologies or main points in Web Development road-map. However, this doesn't mean that they are only to concider there are many other tools and technologies to go with when in Web Development we can take examples of;

- Designing tools

- Code editors that can be refered to as an integrated development environment (IDE) here on my side I recommend **VS Code** meanwhile there are many other best out there.

- Version control softwares

What is it? 

**Version control** is used to track revisions, solve integration conflicts in code, and manage different actions involved in software projects.
Here most prefer to go with Git & GitHub collable.

**Git** Yeah, Git is a version control as explained above.

**Why GitHub?** GitHub is not a version control, it offers a cloud-based Git repositories hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.

**-------------------------------------------------------------**

We cover PHP on Backend side. Also there many other different languages like Python, JavaScript, Java, Ruby,...

By developing you may need to try Frameworks or Libraries for smooth work. 

[PHP](https://github.com/pacineee/Web-Applications-for-Everybody-Quick-Walk-through/blob/main/php.md) has different frameworks and libraries to concider.

We can put on the list some; - Laravel - Symfony - CodeIgniter - CakePHP - Zipstream - *The list goes on...*

On [CSS](https://github.com/pacineee/Web-Applications-for-Everybody-Quick-Walk-through/blob/main/css.md)
We can say; - Bootstrap - Tailwind CSS - Skeleton - Bulma - *the list goes on...*

On [JavaScript](https://github.com/pacineee/Web-Applications-for-Everybody-Quick-Walk-through/blob/main/js.md) 
we can put on the list; - Vue.js - React.js - Node.js - Express.js - Ember.js - Angular - *The list goes on...*


**Note:** HTML, CSS and JavaScript are the core and must know tools/technologies for Web Development.

By now all I can say is, **Be blessed in all ‚ù§üíôü•∞**
