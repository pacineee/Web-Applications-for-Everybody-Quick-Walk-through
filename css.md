## Cascading Style Sheet

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a **stylesheet** language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen.

### What is CSS and how does it work!?

Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.

A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.
The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.

 CSS can be performed as **inline, internal and external CSS** 
 
 What is the differenceðŸ¤”?

**Inline CSS** styles an individual HTML element by adding a style attribute on the element's opening tag.

It is advised that we always end each inline style declaration with a semicolon (;).

**Internal CSS** styles an HTML page's content by adding an HTML < style> element in the < head> section of the HTML document.

**External CSS** styles one or more HTML pages' content by linking the HTML document to an external stylesheet.

By creating an external CSS stylesheet yyou have to save the file with a .css extensionâ€”for instance, my-styles.css.
