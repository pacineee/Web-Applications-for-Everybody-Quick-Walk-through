## Introduction
# What is Web Development!?
* Web Development * is an act or art to create Websites and Web Applications using different processes, skills and techniques.
Web Development constists of three main parts that are; Front-End, Back-End and Database Management. Of course the main fields we have is Front-end and Back-end
So, when you deal with both you're doing Full-stack (You're a Full-Stack developer).

### Front-End Side
Front-end is the side that user interact with when exploring or using your site or Web Application. 
It many of times have images, videos, animations, colors and other differnet designs to make it attractable and smooth to the users.
The main tools in Front-end are; Html, CSS and JavaScript. However, there are other concepts to consider regarding your project requirements.

### Back-End side
Back-end is the side that is invisible to the direct users and it helps in functionality of application or site.
As a wuick take Back-end is behind the scene of any application. To ensure fully fucntionality you may also deal with Servers aand Databases.
In this Repo we're looking about PHP and SQL.
Even though there are so many languages to deal with Back-end PHP is very suited to Web Development, hence it's name "Hypertext Preprocessor".

### Structure Query Language
Is a standard programming language that is designed to manage data held in Reletional Database Management System (RDBMS).
When modifying database table and index structures; adding, updating and deleting rows of data; and retrieving subsets of information from within RDBMS here comes SQL.

### Go for it
Web Development is a cool and rewardinng career.
A typical day in the life of a web developer mostly consists of spending time sitting down in front of a computer.
Also a Web Developer is a life-time learner, you never stop learning.
Meet the challenges, look for solutions, enjoy the ride...that's beauty of coding ðŸ¤—ðŸ¥°
